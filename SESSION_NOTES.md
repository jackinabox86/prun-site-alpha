# Development Session Notes - Further Polish Branch

## Date
2025-10-03

## Branch
`further-polish` (created from `main`)

## Session Summary
This session focused on UI polish and improvements to the ReportClient component and BestScenarioSankey component.

---

## Features Attempted

### 1. ✅ Font Family Consistency (COMPLETED)
**Description:** Applied the Sankey chart's font family to the entire page for visual consistency.

**Implementation:**
- Added font family to main element: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif`
- Added `fontFamily: "inherit"` to all form controls (input, select, button)

**Status:** Successfully implemented

---

### 2. ✅ Sankey Hover Tooltip Improvements (COMPLETED)
**Description:** Updated the Area/day display in Sankey node hover tooltips to match the summary box.

**Changes Made:**
- Changed label from "Area/day (full)" to "Area/day"
- Changed data source from `fullSelfAreaPerDay` to `totalAreaPerDay` (with fallback to `fullSelfAreaPerDay`)
- Changed formatting function from `fmt` to `fmtROI` for consistency
- Applied to both root node and child nodes

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/BestScenarioSankey.tsx`

**Status:** Successfully implemented

---

### 3. ❌ Readme Toggle Button (ATTEMPTED - NOT COMPLETED)
**Description:** Add a collapsible readme section with a toggle button.

**Intended Features:**
- Toggle button next to page heading
- Button text: "Hide Readme" / "Expand Readme"
- Button colors: light red (#ffebee) when hiding, light green (#e8f5e9) when expanding
- Centered heading and button within 900px width constraint
- Default state: expanded

**Issues Encountered:**
- Sankey chart disappeared when toggling the readme button
- Attempted fixes:
  1. Using React key prop to force remount (caused chart to disappear on repeated toggles)
  2. Triggering window resize events with setTimeout (50ms, 100ms, 300ms, 500ms delays)
  3. Moving key to wrapper div
  4. Changing conditional rendering structure
- None of the fixes resolved the disappearing Sankey chart issue

**Status:** Reverted - not implemented due to rendering issues

---

### 4. ❌ Sankey Key Feature (ATTEMPTED - REMOVED)
**Description:** Add explanatory text below the Sankey chart.

**Attempted Implementations:**
1. Toggle button with collapsible key text
2. Static text line (no button)

**Issues Encountered:**
- Both implementations caused the Sankey chart to disappear when the readme was toggled
- Structural changes to the DOM around the Sankey component caused Plotly rendering issues

**Status:** Completely removed

---

## Technical Challenges

### Plotly Rendering Issues
The main technical challenge was Plotly's Sankey chart disappearing when DOM structure changed above it (readme collapse/expand).

**Root Cause:**
- Plotly charts are sensitive to DOM layout changes
- When elements above the chart change height/visibility, Plotly sometimes fails to recalculate properly
- The `useResizeHandler` prop on the Plot component wasn't sufficient to handle these changes

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Key-based remounting:** Adding a key prop that changes with state
   - Result: Chart remounted but disappeared on subsequent toggles

2. **Window resize events:** Dispatching resize events after DOM updates
   - Result: Still caused disappearing chart issues

3. **Multiple resize events with delays:** Trying different timing combinations
   - Result: No improvement

**Lesson Learned:**
Avoid making structural changes to the DOM above dynamically-loaded Plotly charts. If collapse/expand functionality is needed, it should be implemented in a way that doesn't affect the chart's container or ancestors.

## Files Modified (Final State)

### `app/components/ReportClient.tsx`
- Added font family to main element
- Added `fontFamily: "inherit"` to input, select, and button elements

### `app/components/BestScenarioSankey.tsx`
- Updated root hover tooltip: `Area/day: ${fmtROI(best.totalAreaPerDay ?? best.fullSelfAreaPerDay)}`
- Updated child hover tooltip: `Area/day: ${fmtROI((child as any).totalAreaPerDay ?? child.fullSelfAreaPerDay)}`
- Updated ROI formatting in child hover: changed from `fmt` to `fmtROI`

## Git Status

### Current Branch
`further-polish`

### Changes Ready to Commit
1. Font family consistency across ReportClient
2. Sankey hover tooltip improvements

### Changes Not Included
- Readme toggle button (reverted)
- Sankey key feature (removed)

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Readme Toggle:** If collapsible readme is desired, consider:
   - Implementing it in a separate route/page
   - Using CSS transitions instead of conditional rendering
   - Placing the Sankey chart in a fixed position that doesn't change when content above it changes

2. **Sankey Chart Stability:**
   - Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Plotly/react-plotly.js if available
   - Investigate alternative charting libraries that handle DOM changes better
   - Document the sensitivity to DOM changes for future developers

3. **Testing:**
   - Add visual regression tests for the Sankey chart
   - Test chart rendering across different screen sizes and browsers

## Next Steps

1. Review and test the implemented changes
2. Create PR for `further-polish` branch to `main`
3. Consider alternative approaches for readme collapse functionality if still desired
