# Integrate Inflation Index Tool into Hugo Website

## Context

I have an inflation index calculator built in Next.js that I want to integrate into a Hugo-based website. The Next.js app is deployed at: **[INSERT YOUR DEPLOYED URL HERE]** (e.g., https://your-site.com/inflation)

The Hugo website repository is: https://github.com/andykorth/oogcapitalmanagement

## Objective

Create a pull request to the oogcapitalmanagement repository that:

1. **Adds a new page** for the inflation index tool that embeds it via iframe
2. **Adds a navigation link** to the site's tools page so visitors can find it
3. **Seamlessly integrates styling** so the iframe doesn't appear to be a separate page - it should match the Hugo site's color scheme and layout

## Hugo Site Structure

The Hugo site has the following structure:
- `/content/` - Markdown files for posts and pages
- `/static/` - Static content (favicons, images, embedded webapps)
- `/assets/images` - Images processed through Hugo's pipeline
- `/themes/tailbliss` - The site theme
- `/public/` - Build output directory (generated by Hugo)

Deployment is done via rsync/SFTP to a web server.

## Requirements

### 1. Create Inflation Index Page

Create a new page in the Hugo site at `/content/tools/inflation.md` (or similar appropriate location) that:

- Has a descriptive title like "Inflation Index Calculator" or "PRUN Inflation Tracker"
- Contains a brief description of what the tool does
- Embeds the inflation tool via iframe with the following requirements:
  - Full width of the content area
  - Appropriate height (or responsive height if possible)
  - No visible border that makes it obvious it's an iframe
  - Seamless integration with the page styling

### 2. Style Integration

The iframe and page must be styled to match the Hugo site's theme:

**Hugo Site Color Scheme** (infer from the tailbliss theme or existing pages):
- Background colors should match the site's background
- Text colors should match the site's typography
- The transition from Hugo content to iframe should be imperceptible

**CSS Requirements:**
- Remove iframe borders
- Match background colors between Hugo page and iframe content
- Ensure scrolling works naturally
- Mobile responsive

### 3. Add Navigation Link

Add a link to the new inflation tool page in the appropriate location:
- If there's a "Tools" section in the navigation, add it there
- If there's a tools index page, add a card/link there
- Ensure the link follows the existing navigation pattern

### 4. Next.js App Adjustments

The Next.js inflation app may need minor CSS adjustments to match the Hugo site's color scheme. The current app uses these colors:

```
Background: #0a0e14, #101419
Text: #e6e8eb, #a0a8b5
Accent: #ff9500
```

Provide guidance on what color scheme the Hugo site uses, and suggest any CSS overrides needed in the Next.js app.

## Deliverables

The PR should include:

1. **New content page** (`/content/tools/inflation.md` or similar)
2. **Navigation updates** (modified menu/navigation files)
3. **Any custom CSS/styling** needed for iframe integration
4. **Updated tools index page** (if one exists)
5. **Clear PR description** explaining the changes

## Additional Notes

- The Hugo site uses version v147 (extended may be required)
- The site is manually deployed via rsync/SFTP (no GitHub Actions)
- Preserve the existing site structure and styling conventions
- Follow the site's existing markdown/content patterns

## Success Criteria

When complete:
- A visitor can navigate to the inflation tool from the main site
- The embedded tool appears as a native part of the Hugo site
- The styling is consistent - no obvious visual break between Hugo content and iframe
- The tool is fully functional within the iframe
- Mobile users can access and use the tool effectively
